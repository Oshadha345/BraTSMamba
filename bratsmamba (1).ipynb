This is a heavily researched and critical area vital for bio-medical engineering field. This problem is in the domain of computer vision, specifically semantic segmentation tasks. \n\nSemantic segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, requiring the precise classification of every pixel in an image. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like U-Net excel at capturing local features but often struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited receptive fields. Transformers addressed this with self-attention, but at the cost of quadratic computational complexity($O(N^2)$), making them heavy for high-resolution tasks.\n\n**Why Mamba?** We address this trade-off using **Mamba-SSM (State Space Models)**. Mamba offers linear complexity ($O(N)$) with respect to sequence length, allowing us to model global context (long-range dependencies) without the massive memory overhead of Transformers.\n\n**The Solution: BratsMamba** \nThis notebook implements BratsMamba, a hybrid architecture that combines the hierarchical structure of a U-Net with Mamba blocks. This allows us to capture:\n1. **Local Texture Details**: Via convolutional stems and decoder blocks.\n3. **Global Semantic Context**: Via Mamba encoders that scan the image as a sequence, understanding the \"whole picture\" efficiently.\n\n### Key Technical Features:\n* **Architecture:** Dual-Path Conv Stem + Mamba Encoder/Decoder + U-Net Skip Connections.\n* **Data Pipeline:** Lazy loading from internal disk (`/tmp`) to handle large datasets without RAM explosion.\n* **Robustness:** Implements `SpatialPadd` and `DivisiblePadd` to handle variable MRI volume sizes preventing shape mismatches.\n* **Evaluation:** Clinical metrics (Dice & HD95) calculated on Whole Tumor (WT), Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Imports","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# =============================================================================\n# general imports\n# =============================================================================\n\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport time\nimport json\nimport tarfile\nimport subprocess\nimport warnings\nimport random\nimport shutil\nimport glob as gb\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\n# suppress cluttered warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# mamba-ssm, monai, nibabel and einops\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nprint(\"⚙️ Checking and Installing Dependencies...\")\nstart_install = time.time()\n\n# Helper to install if missing\ndef install_package(package_name, pip_name=None):\n    if pip_name is None: pip_name = package_name\n    try:\n        __import__(package_name)\n    except ImportError:\n        print(f\"   Installing {pip_name}...\")\n        subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, \"-m\", \"pip\", \"install\", pip_name, \"--quiet\"])\n\n# 1.

Small kernels capture these high-frequency edges.\n          * **Receptive Field**: Large kernels capture the \"neighborhood\" context immediately.\n          * **Paper Reference**: *Swin UNETR* (Hatamizadeh et al., 2022) highlights the importance of patch merging, but notes that Transformers often lose local spatial details early on. Our Dual-Stem preserves this before the Mamba layers take over.\n          \n2. **The Mamba Encoder (The Engine)**\n      * **The Component**: Stacked Mamba Blocks that flatten the 3D volume into a 1D sequence.\n      * **The Reason**:\n          * **The Problem**: Standard Self-Attention (Transformers) scales quadratically ($N^2$). For a 3D volume of $128^3$, the sequence length is ~2 million. A Transformer would run out of memory immediately.\n          * **The Solution**: Mamba scales linearly ($N$). It allows us to scan the entire 3D brain volume as a single sequence, understanding that \"a pixel at the top left\" is related to \"a pixel at the bottom right\" (Global Context).\n            * **Global Scanning**: The Mamba block scans the image left-to-right, right-to-left, and top-to-bottom, effectively \"seeing\" the whole brain at once to decide if a pixel is tumor or noise. \n          * **Paper Reference**: SegMamba (Xing et al., 2024) demonstrates that Mamba outperforms Transformers on 3D medical data by reducing memory usage by 60% while improving Dice scores on the BraTS dataset.\n\n3. **Deep Supervision & Skip Connections**\n    * **The Component**: Direct connections between the Encoder and Decoder at matching resolutions.\n    * **The Reason**: As the network goes deeper to understand \"shapes\" (Tumor vs Brain), it loses spatial resolution. Skip connections inject the high-resolution texture details from the Stem directly into the Decoder, ensuring the final mask has sharp edges.\n    * **Paper Reference**: nnU-Net (Isensee et al., 2020) proves that robust encoder-decoder connections are often more important than the choice of optimizer or activation function.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# =============================================================================\n# 🧠 MODEL ARCHITECTURE: BRATMAMBA\n# =============================================================================\ntry:\n    from mamba_ssm import Mamba\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"⚠️ WARNING: mamba_ssm not found.
